              including Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Android and Mac iOS
              (collectively, referred to as the “Services”) and any information,

            <h2 className={headingClasses}>1. Who can use the Services</h2>
            <p>
              Anyone who is not barred from using the Services under the laws of
              the applicable jurisdiction, and is at least 13 years of age can
              use the Service. If you are living in the United Kingdom or a

            <h2 className={headingClasses}>3. Our Services</h2>
            <p>
              Our Services are intended to inform you and educate you about
              using our private and secure communications app (Session Website),
              and facilitate private and secure communications between two or
              more parties, or within a closed group or within an open group
              (Session, or Session App).
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 className={headingClasses}>3.1. Using the Session Website</h3>
            <p>
              The purpose of the Session Website is primarily to provide you
              with information about the Session App and link to download of the
              Session App. We have done our best to make sure this information
              is accurate and up-to-date, however, there may be unintentional
              errors that may mislead you. Therefore, we encourage you to
              contact us for any clarifications you may need.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The Session Website also enables you to submit your contact
              details, so we are able to keep you informed about our work.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 className={headingClasses}>3.2. Using the Session App</h3>
            <p>
              The purpose of the Session App is to facilitate private and secure
              communications, without capturing or sharing any meta-data. It was
              intentionally created for use by individuals who require anonymity
              and security.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <b>What do we mean by ‘private’?</b> The Session App does not
              require you to identify yourself in any way or associate your
              personally identifiable information including phone numbers or
              email addresses with the account you create on the Session App
              (known as a Session ID). The onion-routing technology behind
              Session means that your communications are not only free of
              meta-data, but you can also be completely anonymous and
              untraceable. There is no way for us, or anyone else to link your
              Session ID with your real identity — unless you create such a link
              by indicating your real identity through your communications, or
              associating your real identity with your Session ID through some
              other means.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <b>What do we mean by ‘secure’?</b> The messages you create on
              your Session App are encrypted and only the destination Session ID
              can dy-encrypt the message. The encrypted messages are wrapped in
              multiple layers of onion encryption and routed from the Session
              App through our distributed onion network before reaching their
              destination. While we make every effort to ensure security, we
              cannot be held responsible for any interception or decryption
              using advanced technologies, now or in the future.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The Session App is a messaging app, and does not have the ability
              to communicate with non-Session Apps or services. Our Services do
              not provide access to public emergency service providers like the
              police, fire department, hospitals, or other public safety
              organizations.
